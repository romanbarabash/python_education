"""
The first argument passed to __init__() must always be the keyword self -
this is how the object keeps track of itself internally - but we can pass additional variables after that.
In order to assign a variable to the class (creating a member variable), we use dot notation.
For instance, if we passed newVariable into our class, inside the __init__() function we would say:
self.new_variable = new_variable
